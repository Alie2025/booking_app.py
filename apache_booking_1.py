  Apache Airlines — Burak757 Seat Booking System
  FC723 Programming Theory  |  Project Part A
================================================================

PURPOSE:
  This program manages seat reservations for the Apache Airlines
  Burak757 aircraft. Staff or customers use a numbered menu to
  check seat availability, make bookings, cancel bookings, and
  view the current state of the entire cabin.

AIRCRAFT LAYOUT — Burak757 floor plan:
  The Burak757 is a narrow-body jet with a single centre aisle.
  The cabin grid has 7 columns and uses the following codes:

      Column index:  0    1    2    3    4    5    6
      Column label:  A    B    C    |    D    E    F

  Row 0         : S  S  S  S  S  S  S   (front galley / storage)
  Rows 1–2      : First Class  — A  B  X  D  E  (2+2, narrower)
  Rows 3–7      : Business     — A  B  C  X  D  E  F (3+3)
  Rows 8–30     : Economy      — A  B  C  X  D  E  F (3+3)
  Row 31        : S  S  S  S  S  S  S   (rear galley / storage)

  Key:
      'F'  = Free seat          (available to book)
      'R'  = Reserved           (used only in Part A — Part B uses ref)
      'X'  = Aisle              (cannot be booked)
      'S'  = Storage / Galley   (cannot be booked)

CLASSES USED:
  SeatMap            — stores and manages the aircraft seating grid
  ReferenceGenerator — produces unique 8-character booking codes
  BookingSystem      — handles all booking operations
  Menu               — displays the menu and drives the main loop

    Represents the physical layout of the Burak757 aircraft cabin.

    The cabin is stored as a 2-D list (a list of rows, where each

    floor plan looks on paper — rows top-to-bottom, seats left-to-right.

    Seat status codes:
        'F'  — free (can be booked)
        'X'  — aisle (not a seat)
